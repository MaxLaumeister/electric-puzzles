Component ideas:
Resistor - slows down a signal
Diode - allows signal in one direction only
Fuse - works only once, then burns out
Filter - lets only one color through
Auto-switch - switch with a visible timer that switches automatically
Solar panel - automatically adds signals to puzzle
Switch - manual flip which way signal goes. Need art or tutorial to make it clear you can interact with it.
